HOW?
the program will continuously spit out text for you to review in the following format:

> ID: (ignore this)
> Original: (what i stole from allrecipes.com)
> Processed: (what the computer guessed was the food item)

you will be prompted for if you agree or not with the computers guess. the input options are:
1 - (YES, the computers guess was correct)
0 - (NO, the computer was wrong)
-1 - (SKIP, im not sure)
exit - (for when youre tired of this bullshit)

if you enter '0', it will prompt you for what the correct guess actually is.

but what is actually correct or incorrect? also, why the hell are we doing this?

WHY?
the goal is to extract the name of the specific food items (what you would buy at the store), and remove any descriptors such as:
- units, such as "pinch".
- things that you would personally DO to the food item, such as "chopped".
- descriptors that arent necessary to distinguish the food item, such as "fresh" or "organic".
- descriptors that do distinguish a specific food item, but are really just a personal preference, such as "jasmine rice". Dude just say rice.

below is a collection of examples of what to count as correct, incorrect, and which to just skip for now. when in doubt, just skip it.

Correct:
- Lemon Zest (adding zest is very different than adding lemon)
- Lime Juice (when do you use an entire lime and not the juice?)
- white sugar (keep descriptors to destinguish from brown sugar)
- all purpose flour (different kinds of flour, not interchangable)
- red bell pepper (colour is specific to the food)
- tomato paste (reasonable to buy, rather than pureeing your own tomatoes)
- sun dried tomato (same deal, different than just tomato, and you arent going to make it yourself)

incorrect:
- ground cinnamon -> cinnamon (ground is standard. if it meant cinnamon sticks, they would have specified that)
- ground black pepper -> black pepper (again if the pepper isnt ground, it should say peppercorns)
- jazmine rice -> rice (personal choice)
- chicken bouillon granules -> chicken bouillon (granules is technically the unit the bouillon comes in)
- dried basil leaves -> basil (personal preference)
- kosher salt, sea salt -> salt (personal preference)
- english cucumber -> cucumber (personal preference)
- extra virgin olive oil -> olive oil (virgin / extra virgin are basically interchangable)
- small avocado -> avocado (small avocado is not a different food than big avocado)

skip over:
- things that only have the name brand listed, and not the food item.
- things that list multiple items in the sentence.
- things that should NOT be bought, by anyone (packaged mashed potatoes)
- things that dont have a quantity in the original. It was probably a subtitle.
